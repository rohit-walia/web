        I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the starting point of my career. And I was really good at it too, delivering around 300 houses every week.

        I love cars and instead of midnight walks along the beach, I prefer midnight drives along Mississauga Rd. <br><br>
        The very first car I bought was a 2013 Subaru brz (the background pic). Pushing a decent 200hp with 2.0L naturally aspirated FA20 engine. I shortly traded it for a 2012 bmw 128i which is a straight-6 NA.<br><br>

        My University years were some of my toughest times endured because I had set a goal which many students could not achieve. My goal was to graduate debt free and without any financial assistance. This goal was tough because I started with absolutely nothing and in order to achieve this goal I would have to make a few sacrifices and work really really hard... and boy, was I determined.<br><br>
        I worked full-time overnight shifts for an airline catering company as a billing analyst. Although it was shift work, I asked to be permanently placed in nightshift so I could attend my schooling during the day. During these nightshifts, I developed my very first software solution to time consuming manual processes within the department. My program was essentially doing 50% of my job requirements in the time span of a few minutes and that allowed me to be more productive.<br><br>
        After some number crunching, I realized my sole income wasn't enough to pay the enormous tuition fee's so I started looking for an on-campus student job. It wasn't long until I was hired part-time as a Digital Communications Assistant. With income coming from both jobs and many sacrifices, I was able to graduate debt free.<br><br>
        On multiple occasions I got asked <i>"What's your secret to managing all this?"</i> Answer: The opportunity is available for any abled body but at a cost: you may have to sacrifice sleep, family time, & birthday parties; You may have to settle for the 3-hour nap in the backseat of your car vs 1/2 hour if you had driven home; You may have to settle for street food instead of home cooked meals. People already know hard work pays off but what they don't know lies beyond just effort: <b><i>success demands sacrifices</i></b>.
