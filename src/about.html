        I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the foundational building blocks of my professional skillset. I honed my administrative skills from converting 50lbs of disorganized paper into packaged newspaper ready for distribution. I got creative and innovative as I expanded from delivering 100 houses to 200, eventually 300 houses.

        During my time working overnights as a billing analyst for an airline catering company, I developed software that automated time consuming manual processes. My program was essentially doing 50% of my job requirements which allowed me to sneak in some homework time and occasionally some nap time. <br><br>
        On multiple occasions I got asked <i>"how did you manage a full-time overnights job plus full-time schooling?"</i> Answer: The opportunity is available for any abled body but at a extravagant cost: you may have to sacrifice sleep, family time, & birthday parties. You may have to settle for the 3 hour nap in the backseat of your car vs 1/2 hour if you drive home. You may have to settle for street food instead of home cooked meals.

        One of the magnificant attributes of the human mind and body is it's ability to adapt. After a year of working full time overnights and being a full time student, I realized I had adapted to this stressful schedule. What I thought was overwhelming in the beginning, was no longer anymore.<br><br>
        So what did i do? I pickup up a part-time job at my university as a Digital Communications Assistant. Yes folks, I was officially a full time student with a full time job + part time job.

        I was part of a website harmonization team focused in content management for the institutionâ€™s web presence: yorku.ca. My ability to take on complex tasks was quickly acknowledged by the department manager and I was given two addition projects:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Create the Information Architecture (IA) allowing staff to efficiently search and locate specific webpage content.</li>
          <li>Conduct statistical analysis on website requisition data to gain more insight about content change over time.</li>

        I remember the moment I had graduated from York University. I was writing two important letters. My first letter was a notice of resignation and the other was a thank you letter. I was excited to exit Gate Gourmet to persue my career in the tech industry and I was sad to leave my part-time campus job simpily because I met some amazing people and a manager who believed in me. All in all, I had acomplished one of my milestones in life, namely to graduate debt free without anyone's help.

        Six days after my last day working as a Billing Analyst, I started my new job as a 'Software QA' at PointClickCare. One year later after that, I jumped a multiple roles up to 'Automation Developer' which brings us to my current employer and position. Some people might think I've "made it" but I am not done yet, I am just getting started...
