    <td>I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the foundational building blocks of my professional skillset. I honed my administrative skills from converting 50lbs of disorganized paper into packaged newspaper ready for distribution. I got creative and innovative as I expanded from delivering 100 houses to 200, eventually 300 houses.</td>

    <td>During my time working overnights as a billing analyst in the logistics department for an airline catering company, I developed software that automated time consuming manual processes. My program was essentially doing 50% of my job requirements which allowed me to sneak in an hour nap, essential for when I would have to go straight to school and attend multiple 3-hour lectures. Friends always asked me "how did you manage a full-time overnights job plus full-time schooling?" Answer: You make it happen. Its not easy, I sacrificed a majority of my sleep, family time, and friends birthdays; however, I was determined to graduate debt free.</td>

    <td>One of the magnificant attributes of the human mind and body is it's ability to adapt to changing enviornments. After a year of working full time overnights at Gate Gourmet and being a full time student, I realized I had adapted to this stressful enviornment. What I thought was overwhelming in the beginning, was no longer anymore. This is called 'repetitive learning'; when you do something over and over again, you tend to get more efficent at it and this was precicely the case in my situation. So what did i do? I pickup up a part-time job at my university as a Digital Communications Assistant.</td>
