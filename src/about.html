    <td>I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the foundational building blocks of my professional skillset. I honed my administrative skills from converting 50lbs of disorganized paper into packaged newspaper ready for distribution. I got creative and innovative as i expanded from delivering 100 houses to 200, eventually 300 houses.</td>
