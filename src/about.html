    <td>I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the foundational building blocks of my professional skillset. I honed my administrative skills from converting 50lbs of disorganized paper into packaged newspaper ready for distribution. I got creative and innovative as i expanded from delivering 100 houses to 200, eventually 300 houses.</td>

    <td>During my time working overnights as a billing analyst in the logistics department for an airline catering company, I developed software that automated time consuming manual processes. My program was essentially doing 50% of my job requirements which allowed me to sneak in an hour nap, essential for when i would have to go straight to school and attend multiple 3-hour lectures. Friends always asked me "how did you manage a full-time overnights job plus full-time schooling?" Answer: You make it happen. Its not easy, i sacrificed a majority of my sleep, family time, and friends birthdays; however, I was determined to graduate debt free.</td>
