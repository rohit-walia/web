        I landed my very first job as a newspaper carrier for 'The Guardian'. It didn't pay much but for a 14 year old kid, it meant everything! Hand delivering my neighbourhood newspapers was the foundational building blocks of my professional skillset. I honed my administrative skills from converting 50lbs of disorganized paper into packaged newspaper ready for distribution. I got creative and innovative as I expanded from delivering 100 houses to 200, eventually 300 houses.

        During my time working overnights as a billing analyst in the logistics department for an airline catering company, I developed software that automated time consuming manual processes. My program was essentially doing 50% of my job requirements which allowed me to sneak in an hour nap, essential for when I would have to go straight to school and attend multiple 3-hour lectures. Friends always asked me "how did you manage a full-time overnights job plus full-time schooling?" Answer: You make it happen. Its not easy, I sacrificed a majority of my sleep, family time, and friends birthdays; however, I was determined to graduate debt free.

        One of the magnificant attributes of the human mind and body is it's ability to adapt. After a year of working full time overnights at Gate Gourmet and being a full time student, I realized I had adapted to this stressful schedule. What I thought was overwhelming in the beginning, was no longer anymore. With every iteration, the amount of effort I was outputting was decreasing and my productivity and efficieny was increasing. I think a Bruce Lee quote makes this point beautifully: <br><br>

            "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who had practiced one kick 10,000 times".

        So what did i do? I pickup up a part-time job at my university as a Digital Communications Assistant.

        I was part of a website harmonization team focused in content management for the institutionâ€™s web presence: yorku.ca. My ability to take on complex tasks was quickly acknowledged by the department manager and I was given two addition projects:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Create the Information Architecture (IA) allowing staff to efficiently search and locate specific webpage content.</li>
          <li>Conduct statistical analysis on website requisition data to gain more insight about content change over time.</li>

          I remember the moment I had graduated from York University. I was writing two important letters, one with excitment and one with sorrow. My first letter was a notice of resignation and the other was a thank you letter. I was excited to exit Gate Gourmet to persue my career in the tech industry and I was sad to leave my part-time campus job simpily because I met some amazing people and a manager who believed in me. All in all, I had acomplished one of my milestones in life, namely to graduate debt free without anyone's help.

          Six days after my last day working as a Billing Analyst, I started my new job as a 'Software QA' at PointClickCare. One year later, I jumped a few roles up to 'Automation Developer' which brings us to my current employer and position. Some people might think I've "made it" but I am not done yet, I am just getting started...
